## Prompt 63: Net Metering and Distributed Generation
```
#CONTEXT:
Pakistan's net metering policy (2015) allows rooftop solar but 
distribution companies (DISCOs) resisting implementation. Slow 
approvals, restrictive caps, billing disputes. Need reform.

#ROLE:
You are David Jacobs, IEA expert on distributed energy policy. 15 
years advising on net metering. Expert on "Prosumer Regulation" and 
"Grid Integration of Distributed RE."

#TASK:

- Gen 3: Dynamic pricing + storage (market-based)

#OUTPUT FORMAT:
Net Metering Reform (1500 words):
1. Barrier Analysis:
   - DISCOs: revenue loss fear, technical capacity weak
   - Regulatory: NEPRA approval process slow
   - Technical: grid not designed for distributed generation
2. Policy Redesign:
   - Remove capacity caps (currently 1 MW per consumer, remove limit)
   - Simplify approvals (online application, 30-day auto-approval if 
     no response)
   - Fair compensation: export tariff at avoided cost (PKR 15/kWh)
   - Net billing (not net metering): pay for export, charge for import
3. Grid Code:
   - Safety: mandatory disconnect switch, anti-islanding
   - Power quality: inverter standards (IEEE 1547)
   - Metering: bidirectional smart meters (mandatory for >10 kW)
4. DISCO Compensation:
   - Revenue adequacy: tariff design allows cost recovery (even with 
     DG)
   - Performance incentives: tie revenue to reliability, not kWh sold

2. System costs (externalities: health, environment, water)
3. Stranded asset risk (coal plants may be uneconomic before 
   depreciation)
4. Recommend: complete Thar projects or cancel and shift to RE?

#FRAMEWORK:
"Total Cost of Energy":
- Private cost (LCOE)
- External cost (pollution, health, carbon)
- System cost (flexibility, transmission, storage)
- Risk cost (stranded assets, price volatility)

#OUTPUT FORMAT:
Economic Comparison Study (1800 words):
1. LCOE Analysis:
   - Thar coal: PKR 8-10/kWh (fuel, O&M, capex recovery)
   - Wind: PKR 5-6/kWh (falling)
   - Solar: PKR 4-5/kWh (falling)
2. Externalities:
   - Coal: health costs PKR 50B/year (air pollution), water scarcity 
     (Thar)
   - Renewables: intermittency cost PKR 2-3/kWh (need storage/backup)
3. Stranded Asset Risk:
   - Coal plants: 30-year contracts but may be uneconomic in 10 years
   - NPV loss: PKR 500B if shut early
4. Climate Commitments:
   - Pakistan NDC: 60% renewables by 2030
   - Carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM): exports may face tariffs
5. Recommendation:
   - Complete Thar Phase 1 (sunk cost, avoid contractual penalties)
   - Cancel Thar Phase 2+ (not yet contracted)
   - Deploy renewables aggressively (10 GW wind, 10 GW solar by 2030)
   - Repurpose Thar for other industries (gasification, chemicals)

#SCENARIOS:
- Business as usual (more coal): higher costs, stranded assets
- Transition (balance): complete existing, then shift
- Leapfrog (all renewables): lowest long-term cost

- Midstream (transmission, storage)
- Downstream (distribution, retail)
- Regulation (pricing, allocation, safety)

#OUTPUT FORMAT:
Gas Sector Reform Strategy (1800 words):
1. Current Challenges:
   - Supply-demand gap: 2.5 Bcfd (met by expensive LNG)
   - Pricing: heavily subsidized (avg PKR 500/mmbtu vs PKR 2500 import 
     cost)
   - Allocation: inefficient (CNG gets gas, export industry doesn't)
   - Losses: 10% system (leakage, theft)
2. Pricing Reform:
   - Principle: move toward cost-reflective pricing (5-year transition)
   - Residential: lifeline slab (0-50 m³) subsidized, higher slabs 
     market price
   - Industrial: full cost recovery (export industry priority supply)
   - Transport: CNG price competitive with petrol (not subsidized)
   - Farmers: fertilizer gets gas (food security), but price increase
3. Supply Strategy:
   - LNG: expand import capacity (3 terminals, 10 Bcfd total)
   - Pipelines: TAPI (Turkmenistan), IP (Iran—if sanctions lift)
   - Domestic: incentivize exploration (higher wellhead prices, reduce 
     red tape)
   - Target: 8 Bcfd supply by 2030 (3 domestic, 5 LNG)
4. Allocation Priority:
   - Tier 1: Residential (social need)
   - Tier 2: Export industry (textile, leather—earn dollars)
   - Tier 3: Fertilizer (food security)
   - Tier 4: Power (only if surplus, otherwise coal/renewables)
   - Tier 5: Transport (CNG—lowest priority, shift to electricity)
5. Loss Reduction:
   - Theft: install smart meters, prosecute theft
   - Leakage: replace old pipelines (50-year old infrastructure)
   - Target: 10%→5% losses in 5 years

#FISCAL IMPACT:
- Subsidy reduction: PKR 500B/year (from pricing reform)
- Revenue from LNG sales: PKR 300B/year

     undivided)
   - Documentation: informal sector, no financial statements
   - Risk: banks perceive smallholders as high-risk
   - Geography: rural branches closed (cost)
2. Product Innovation:
   - Warehouse receipts: store crop, use receipt as collateral (pilot 
     wheat, rice)
   - Group lending: farmer groups (SHG model from microfinance)
   - Crop insurance: subsidized (50% premium by govt, index-based)
   - Supply chain finance: input suppliers give credit, bank finances 
     supplier
3. Digital Lending:
   - Credit scoring: use mobile data, ag data (satellite, IoT) for 
     scoring
   - Disbursement: mobile wallets (no need for branch)
   - Repayment: automatic (after harvest, link to procurement)
4. Institutional:
   - Zarai Taraqiati Bank: focus on smallholders (currently large 
     farmer biased)
   - Commercial banks: ag portfolio targets (10% to smallholders)
   - Microfinance: upscale to agriculture (currently urban bias)
5. Risk Sharing:
   - Credit guarantee: NDRMF guarantees 50% of smallholder loans
   - First-loss: government takes first 10% loss (de-risk banks)

#TARGETS:
- Smallholder credit share: 20%→50%
- Ag credit volume: PKR 1.8T→3T (smallholder portion grows faster)

Simulate 3 policy scenarios (tax, trade, energy)
#FRAMEWORK:
"Standard CGE Model Components":

Production (nested CES: capital, labor, intermediates by sector)
Households (linear expenditure system, multiple household types)
Trade (Arm ington, export supply)
Government (taxes, spending, deficit/surplus)
Closures (macro closures: savings-investment, govt deficit, trade)
#OUTPUT FORMAT:
CGE Model Documentation (2500 words):

Social Accounting Matrix:

Base year: 2022
Dimensions: 50 sectors, 10 household types, factors (5),
government, rest of world
Data sources: PBS (national accounts, HIES), FBR (taxes), SBP
(trade, finance)
Balancing: RAS method (ensure consistency)


Model Structure:

Production:

Technology: nested CES (value-added: capital-labor, then
intermediate inputs)
Factors: 5 types (skilled, unskilled, capital, land, natural
resources)
Sectoral detail: 50 (agriculture 10, industry 20, services 20)


Households:

10 types: rural/urban × 5 income quintiles
Demand: linear expenditure system (LES) or CDE
Income: from factors, transfers, remittances


Trade:

Imports: Armington (domestic and imported goods imperfect
substitutes)
Exports: CET transformation (firms allocate output domestic vs
export)


Government:

Revenue: income tax, corporate tax, GST, tariffs, excise
Spending: consumption, transfers, investment
Deficit: financed by borrowing


Macro Closures:

Savings-investment: investment-driven (fixed savings rate)
Government: deficit/surplus endogenous (adjust spending)
Trade: flexible exchange rate (balance trade)




Calibration:

Elasticities: from literature (trade elasticities, factor
substitution)
Benchmark: SAM is equilibrium (calibrate to replicate 2022)


Simulations:

Scenario 1: Tax Reform (GST 17%→12%, base broadening)

Results: GDP +0.5%, employment +100K, revenues -0.3% GDP
initially then +0.5% (compliance)


Scenario 2: Trade Liberalization (tariffs 11%→7%)

Results: GDP +1.2%, imports +15%, exports +10%, textiles
contract 2% (adjustment), engineering +5%


Scenario 3: Energy Price Reform (subsidy removal, prices +30%)

Results: GDP -0.3% short-term, inflation +2%, but fiscal
savings 1% GDP




Validation:

Historical simulation (replicate 2015-2022, check accuracy)
Sensitivity analysis (vary elasticities, see robustness)


#DELIVERABLES:

## Prompt 112: Fiscal Multiplier Estimation#CONTEXT:
Pakistan needs to know fiscal policy effectiveness: Does govt spending
boost growth? What's the multiplier? Use Structural VAR (SVAR) to
estimate using quarterly data 2010-2025.#ROLE:
You are Valerie Ramey, Professor UCSD, leading expert on fiscal
multipliers. 30 years estimating multipliers using time series. Expert
on "Identification in SVARs" and "Government Spending Shocks."#TASK:
Estimate Pakistan's fiscal multiplier:

Collect quarterly data (GDP, govt spending, revenues, interest rates)
Specify SVAR model (identification strategy)
Estimate multipliers (current spending, development, tax changes)
Robustness checks (different specifications, sample periods)
#METHODOLOGY:
"Structural VAR with Identification Restrictions":

Blanchard-Perotti (2002) approach (institutional info for identification)
Identify govt spending shock (unanticipated increase)
Trace impact on GDP (impulse response function = multiplier)
#OUTPUT FORMAT:
Fiscal Multiplier Study (2000 words):

Data:

Sources: PBS (GDP), Ministry of Finance (spending, revenue),
SBP (monetary)
Variables: real GDP, real govt spending (current, development),
real revenues, policy rate, inflation
Frequency: quarterly (2010Q1-2025Q4, 64 observations)
Transformation: all in real terms, logs for GDP/spending


SVAR Specification:

Variables: [GDP, govt spending, revenues, policy rate] (4-variable
VAR)
Lags: 4 quarters (based on AIC, SC criteria)
Identification:

Blanchard-Perotti: spending decided before GDP known (quarterly)
Revenues respond automatically to GDP (elasticity 1.2)
Policy rate responds to inflation, output gap




Estimation:

Software: EViews, Stata, or R
Results:

Current spending multiplier: 0.6 (1 rupee increase → 0.6 rupee
GDP increase, cumulative 4 quarters)
Development spending multiplier: 1.2 (larger due to productivity
effects)
Tax multiplier: -0.4 (1 rupee tax increase → 0.4 rupee GDP
decrease)


Interpretation: Development spending most effective, current
spending weak


Robustness:

Alternative identification: recursive (Cholesky), sign restrictions
Sub-samples: pre/post-2018, exclude COVID (2020-21)
Additional variables: add external sector (exports, exchange rate)


Policy Implications:

Fiscal consolidation: cut current spending (small GDP hit),
protect development
Stimulus: if needed, prioritize infrastructure (high multiplier)
Tax policy: if raising revenue, choose taxes with lowest multiplier
(on rich, low MPC)


#CAVEATS:

Small sample (64 observations)
Structural breaks (IMF programs, COVID)
Omitted variables (external shocks, confidence)
#DELIVERABLES:

Dataset (Excel/CSV)
Stata/R code (reproducible)
Impulse response graphs
Multiplier estimates table


## Prompt 113: Pakistan vs Bangladesh Growth Divergence#CONTEXT:
1990: Pakistan GDP/capita $500, Bangladesh $300. 2025: Pakistan
$1,800, Bangladesh $2,500. Why did Bangladesh overtake? Comparative
35-year analysis.#ROLE:
You are Kaushik Basu, former World Bank Chief Economist, Professor
Cornell. 40 years in development economics. Expert on "Comparative
Development" and "Growth Diagnostics."#TASK:
Analyze 35-year growth divergence:

Growth accounting (decompose TFP, capital, labor contributions)
Policy differences (trade, industrial, social sectors)
Institutional quality (governance, business environment)
Lessons for Pakistan
#FRAMEWORK:
"Development Accounting + Institutional Analysis":

Growth accounting: Y = A × K^α × L^(1-α)
Structural transformation (agriculture → industry → services)
Policy analysis (what Bangladesh did right, Pakistan wrong)
Political economy (governance, stability)
#OUTPUT FORMAT:
Comparative Growth Study (3000 words):

Growth Accounting (1990-2025):

Pakistan: 4.5% average growth (TFP 0.5%, capital 2.5%, labor 1.5%)
Bangladesh: 6.2% growth (TFP 1.5%, capital 3%, labor 1.7%)
Key: Bangladesh higher TFP growth (productivity gains)


Structural Transformation:

Pakistan: agriculture 50%→19%, but industry stagnant (12%→13%)
Bangladesh: agriculture 60%→13%, industry 10%→35% (mainly garments)
Takeaway: Bangladesh industrialized, Pakistan didn't


Policy Comparison:

Trade:

Bangladesh: export-oriented (garments, quotas then preferences)
Pakistan: inward-looking (high tariffs, import substitution)


Industrial:

Bangladesh: focused (garments, govt support)
Pakistan: diversified (spread thin, no champions)


Education:

Bangladesh: girls' education (stipends), family planning
Pakistan: neglected (education 2.5% GDP vs 3.5% Bangladesh)


Health:

Bangladesh: community health workers, BRAC model
Pakistan: weak primary care




Institutional Quality:

Governance: both weak (Bangladesh ranked worse on corruption)
Business: Bangladesh improved (Doing Business rank 168→168),
Pakistan slipped (108→140)
Stability: paradox (Bangladesh had more political instability but
policy continuity)


Garments Sector Deep Dive:

Bangladesh: $50B exports (80% of total), 4M jobs (mostly women)
Pakistan: $5B textiles (60% of exports), but low value-added
(yarn, cloth, not garments)
Why? Bangladesh: govt support, infrastructure (EPZs), labor (women),
trade preferences (EU GSP+)
Pakistan: energy crisis, labor laws (discourage women), missed
opportunities


Lessons for Pakistan:

Focus: pick sectors (textiles+garments, engineering, IT), support
aggressively
Trade: export-oriented, integrate global value chains
Labor: encourage women (50% of population unutilized)
Stability: policy continuity matters (even if politics unstable)
Social: invest in education, health (human capital delayed
Pakistan)


#DATA SOURCES:

World Bank WDI (GDP, growth, sectors)
Penn World Tables (TFP, capital stocks)
National accounts (PBS, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics)
#DELIVERABLES:

Growth accounting tables
Sector composition charts (both countries, over time)
Policy timeline (major reforms, both countries)
