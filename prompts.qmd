# Conclusion & Implementation Guide {.unnumbered}

## Key Principles for Using These Prompts

### 1. Customization is Essential
- Replace placeholder data `[X]`, `[Y]` with actual values
- Adjust timeframes to current policy cycles
- Add constraints specific to your context

### 2. Combine Prompts for Comprehensive Analysis
Example combinations:
- **Fiscal Crisis Response**: Prompts 6 (Tax Reform) + 9 (Subsidy Reform) + 20 (Pension Reform)
- **Growth Strategy**: Prompts 4 (Binding Constraints) + 5 (Complexity Analysis) + 13 (Export Strategy)
- **Energy Transition**: Prompts 15 (Circular Debt) + 16 (Renewables) + 18 (Water-Energy Nexus)

### 3. Iteration Improves Output
- First pass: use prompt as-is
- Second pass: refine with follow-up questions
- Third pass: add quantitative analysis requests

### 4. Validate with Experts
These prompts generate decision-support analysis, not final decisions. Always:
- Verify data and assumptions
- Test recommendations against ground realities
- Consult domain experts
- Consider political economy constraints

## Technical Requirements
