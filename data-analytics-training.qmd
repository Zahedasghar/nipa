## Session Overview

### Learning Objectives:

1. Distinguish data from governance failures
2. Make defensible evidence-based decisions
3. Avoid common analytical errors
4. Lead data governance institutionally


::: {.notes}
Welcome participants. Emphasize this is NOT a technical training - it's about leadership, accountability, and strategic judgment using data.

# Part 1: The Mindset Shift {background-color="#2C5F2D"}

## From Technical Executor to Strategic Leader

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Earlier Focus 
- Implementing systems
- Following procedures  
- Managing processes
- Technical execution
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Your Responsibility Now 
- **Owning institutional decisions**
- **Defending under audit**
- **Shaping what gets measured**
- **Strategic judgment under uncertainty**
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Core Principle
"Your job is not to trust data blindly or reject it instinctively—but to **own decisions** that data informs."
:::

---

## What Is Data Analytics? 

::: {.incremental}
- **Technical Definition:** Systematic use of evidence to inform decisions

- **Your Reality:** Authority, accountability, and institutional risk

- **The Real Questions:**
  - When do I need data for a defensible decision?
  - When should I override data-driven recommendations?
  - How do I defend my choices under audit or political scrutiny?
  - How do I ensure analytics reveals problems rather than conceals them?
:::

---

## Two Types of Failures

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Data Failure
**Symptom:** Incomplete, outdated, or contradictory information

**Examples:** 

- Beneficiary databases not updated 

- Indicators measuring compliance not outcomes 

- Siloed data across departments 

- Systems that exist but aren't integrated
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Governance Failure  
**Symptom:** Institutional clarity gaps

**Examples:** 

- Unclear who decides what 

- Officers fear analytics = audit exposure 

- No mandate for cross-departmental action 

- Political pressure overrides evidence 

- Weak accountability mechanisms
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
**Critical Insight:** Most "data problems" in government are actually **governance problems**

# Part 2: Common Errors in Data Analysis {background-color="#2C5F2D"}

## Framework from "Thinking Clearly with Data"

---

## Error 1: Selection Bias

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**Selection bias** occurs when the sample analyzed is not representative of the population, leading to distorted conclusions.
:::

### Pakistan Example: School Dropout Analysis

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What the data shows:** 

- Survey of enrolled students shows 95% satisfaction 

- District education officer reports low dropout rates 

- Dashboard shows green indicators
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**What's missing:** 

- **Dropped-out students aren't in the sample!** 

- Out-of-school children invisible 

- Selection bias creates false confidence
:::
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "Am I making decisions based on who **stayed** or who **left**?"

---

## Error 2: Confounding Variables

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**Confounding** happens when an unmeasured factor influences both the treatment and outcome, creating spurious relationships.
:::

### Pakistan Example: Health Clinic Performance

::: {.incremental}
- **Observation:** Clinic A has better health outcomes than Clinic B
- **Quick conclusion:** Clinic A's management is superior
- **Confounding reality:**
  - Clinic A is in urban area (better infrastructure)
  - Clinic B serves remote, poorer population
  - Socioeconomic status confounds the relationship
  - Management quality might be identical or opposite!
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "What else could explain this pattern besides my preferred explanation?"

---

## Error 3: Reverse Causality

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**Reverse causality** occurs when we mistake effect for cause—the arrow points the wrong direction.
:::

### Pakistan Example: Police Presence and Crime

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pattern observed:** 

- Areas with more police have higher crime rates 

- Data correlation is clear and strong

**Wrong conclusion:**  

"Police presence causes crime!"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Actual causality:** 

- High crime areas get more police deployment 

- **Crime causes police presence, not vice versa** 

- Classic reverse causality error

**Correct conclusion:**  

"Police are deployed where needed"
:::
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "Which way does the arrow really point?"

---

## Error 4: Measurement Error & Manipulation

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
When indicators become targets, people optimize for metrics rather than underlying goals (**Goodhart's Law**)
:::

### Pakistan Example: Performance Dashboards

::: {.incremental}
 **Initial goal:** Improve service delivery
 **Metric introduced:** "% of files processed within timeline"
 **What happens:**
   - Officers focus on meeting deadlines
   - Complex cases get delayed or simplified
   - Files are "processed" but problems unresolved
   - Dashboard turns green, ground reality unchanged
 **Measurement gaming:** Officers optimize the indicator, not the outcome
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "Are we measuring what matters, or what's easy to measure?"

---

## Error 5: Ecological Fallacy

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**Ecological fallacy** happens when we incorrectly infer individual-level relationships from aggregate data.
:::

### Pakistan Example: District Education Budget

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Aggregate observation:**
- District X: High education budget per capita
- District X: Low literacy rates

**Tempting conclusion:**
"Education spending doesn't improve literacy"
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Individual reality:**
- Budget goes to urban elite schools
- Rural children remain underserved
- Aggregate data hides distribution
- Individual outcomes vary dramatically
:::
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "Does the average hide important variation?"

---

## Error 6: Survivorship Bias

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**Survivorship bias** occurs when we only analyze "survivors" and ignore those who dropped out, failed, or left.
:::

### Pakistan Example: Training Program Evaluation

::: {.incremental}
- **Data analyzed:** Survey of program completers
- **Finding:** 90% report skills improvement and career benefit
- **Conclusion:** "Highly successful program!"
- **Fatal flaw:** 
  - 40% of participants dropped out mid-program
  - Dropouts excluded from survey (only survivors counted)
  - Those who found it irrelevant or ineffective are invisible
  - Success rate is artificially inflated
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "Who am I NOT seeing in this data?"

---

## Error 7: P-Hacking & Data Dredging

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**P-hacking** is manipulating analysis until you find a statistically significant result, creating false discoveries.
:::

### Pakistan Example: Policy Impact Evaluation

::: {.incremental}
- **Scenario:** Expensive program shows no clear impact
- **Pressure:** "Find something positive for the report"
- **P-hacking tactics:**
  - Test 20 different outcomes until one shows p<0.05
  - Subdivide data by gender, age, region until something is "significant"
  - Exclude "outliers" that weaken the result
  - Report only the positive finding, hide the rest
- **Result:** Spurious conclusion based on statistical noise
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "Am I finding patterns, or manufacturing them?"

---

## Error 8: Ignoring Base Rates (Base Rate Fallacy)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition
**Base rate neglect** occurs when we ignore how common something is in the population when interpreting specific evidence.
:::

### Pakistan Example: Fraud Detection System

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**System specs:**
- Accuracy: 95% (correctly identifies fraud) 

- False positive: 5% 

- **Sounds excellent!**

**Reality:** 

- Fraud rate: 1% of transactions 

- System flags 100 cases
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**What actually happens:**

| | Flagged | Not Flagged |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Actual fraud** | 95 | 5 |
| **False positives** | 4,950 | 94,950 |

**Result:** Only 1.9% of flagged cases are actual fraud!

**98% of alerts are false alarms**
:::
:::

. . .

**Officer's Question:** "How rare is what I'm looking for?"

---

## Summary: 8 Critical Errors

| Error | Key Question |
|-------|--------------|
| **Selection Bias** | Am I seeing the full picture or just survivors? |
| **Confounding** | What else could explain this? |
| **Reverse Causality** | Which way does the arrow point? |
| **Measurement Manipulation** | Am I measuring what matters? |
| **Ecological Fallacy** | Does the average hide variation? |
| **Survivorship Bias** | Who am I NOT seeing? |
| **P-Hacking** | Am I finding or manufacturing patterns? |
| **Base Rate Neglect** | How common is this really? |

::: {.callout-tip}
**Your role:** Ask these questions **before** making decisions, not after audit flags problems.

# Part 3: Pakistan Case Studies {background-color="#2C5F2D"}

## Real Governance Challenges

---

## Case 1: Targeting Errors in Social Protection

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Context
- Federal program uses data to identify beneficiaries
- Sophisticated poverty scoring system
- Complaints increase about exclusion errors

### Problems Identified
- **Data outdated** (last survey 3 years old)
- **Local officers bypass scores** (political pressure)
- **Weak appeals process** (no clear authority)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Analytical Errors Present
- **Selection bias:** Only current beneficiaries surveyed
- **Measurement error:** Poverty score doesn't capture shocks
- **Reverse causality:** Excluded people become poorer

### BPS-19 Decision Questions
1. ⚖️ Who is accountable for targeting errors?
2. 🎯 When should discretion override scores?
3. 📋 How to defend decisions under audit?
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Key point: Without institutional clarity, analytics increases contestation rather than solving it.
:::

---

## Case 2: When Dashboards Hide Reality

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Context
- Provincial department reports high completion rates
- Dashboard shows green indicators
- Independent evaluation shows limited ground impact

### Problems Identified
- **Indicators measure inputs not outcomes**
- **Reports meet deadlines, not solve problems**
- **Field realities invisible to senior officers**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Analytical Errors Present
- **Measurement manipulation:** Gaming the metrics
- **Survivorship bias:** Failed cases don't show up
- **Ecological fallacy:** Aggregate hides variation

### Senior Officials Decision Questions
1. 📊 What indicators should officers demand?
2. 🔍 How can analytics surface problems?
3. ⚠️ When to challenge green dashboards?
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Analytics reinforces bad incentives unless officers reshape what gets measured.
:::

---

## Case 3: Procurement Analytics & Audit Risk

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Context
- Internal audit flags price variations
- Data review shows vendor concentration
- Officers fear using analytics

### Problems Identified
- **Data fragmented across departments**
- **Officers fear: analysis = exposure**
- **No clear ownership of analytics**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Analytical Errors Present
- **Selection bias:** Only audited cases analyzed
- **Confounding:** Price variation may have legitimate reasons
- **P-hacking risk:** Finding problems to justify audit

###  Decision Questions
1. 🛡️ How can analytics reduce officer risk?
2. 📜 What safeguards are needed first?
3. 💼 How to communicate results to leadership?
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Without procedural protection, officers avoid analytics despite inefficiencies.
:::

---

## Case 4: Early Warning & Preventive Governance

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Context
- Multiple departments collect data
- Individual datasets appear normal
- Combined analysis shows early stress signals
- No one has authority to act

### Problems Identified
- **Data siloed across departments**
- **No cross-departmental mandate**
- **Officers hesitate on soft signals**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Analytical Errors Present
- **Base rate fallacy:** Rare events hard to detect
- **Ecological fallacy:** Department-level aggregates hide risks
- **Confounding:** Multiple factors create stress

### Decision Questions
1. ⏰ When should incomplete evidence trigger action?
2. ❓ How much uncertainty is acceptable?
3. ✋ Who takes responsibility for questioned signals?
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
At senior levels, analytics is about timely, defensible judgment under uncertainty.

::: {.incremental}
1. **Clarity:** Do I have authority to make this decision?
2. **Evidence:** What data do I have, and what are its limitations?
3. **Errors:** Which analytical errors might be present?
4. **Alternatives:** What other explanations exist?
5. **Uncertainty:** What don't I know, and does it matter?
6. **Safeguards:** How do I document this for future audit?
7. **Accountability:** Can I defend this under scrutiny?
8. **Learning:** What would tell me I was wrong?
