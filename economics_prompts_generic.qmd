# Quick Start Guide {.unnumbered}

## Getting Started with AI-Assisted Analysis

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Platform
These prompts work best with:
- **Claude** (Anthropic): Best for long-form analysis, nuanced policy discussion
- **ChatGPT-4** (OpenAI): Excellent for technical analysis, data interpretation
- **Gemini** (Google): Strong with multimodal inputs, good for visual data

### Step 2: Prepare Your Prompt
1. **Copy the entire prompt** from this document (including CONTEXT, ROLE, TASK, FRAMEWORK, OUTPUT FORMAT)
2. **Customize data fields** in square brackets [like this] with actual figures
3. **Add specific constraints** relevant to your use case
4. **Specify your audience** (academic paper, policy brief, presentation)

### Step 3: Understand the Expert Role

Each prompt assigns a specialized expert role to the AI. This isn't about impersonating real people—it's about:
- **Framing the analytical perspective** (e.g., debt sustainability expert, trade economist)
- **Activating relevant knowledge** domains in the AI model
- **Setting expectations** for depth and sophistication
- **Ensuring consistency** with established methodologies

The generic roles (e.g., "Sovereign Debt Specialist", "Inflation Targeting Expert") help the AI understand what type of analysis and framework to apply.

### Step 4: Iterative Refinement
First response rarely perfect. Follow up with:
- "Expand section X with more detail on Y"
- "Add numerical examples for the proposed policy"
- "Provide international comparisons with India and Bangladesh"
- "Make this more accessible for non-economists"

### Step 5: Validate and Verify
**CRITICAL**: AI outputs require human verification
- Cross-check all statistics and data points
- Verify methodological approaches with literature
- Consult domain experts before finalizing recommendations
- Test assumptions with sensitivity analysis

## Example Workflow

**Scenario**: You need to design an export competitiveness strategy

1. **Start with Prompt 46** (Export Competitiveness Deep Dive)
2. **Customize**: Add your specific sector data (textiles vs. engineering)
3. **Generate**: Get initial 1,800-word analysis
4. **Refine**: "Now add a 5-year implementation timeline with quarterly milestones"
5. **Cross-reference**: Use Prompt 50 (Trade Logistics) for complementary analysis
6. **Integrate**: Combine insights into comprehensive strategy document
7. **Validate**: Share with trade experts, industry associations
8. **Finalize**: Professional report ready for stakeholders

## Combining Multiple Prompts

For comprehensive policy packages, use multiple prompts in sequence:

**Example**: Textile Sector Revival Strategy
- Prompt 46: Export Competitiveness → Identify constraints
- Prompt 47: Trade Integration → Market access strategy  
- Prompt 50: Trade Logistics → Infrastructure needs
- Prompt 83: Skills Development → Workforce planning
- Prompt 25: Performance Budgeting → Implementation tracking

Each output feeds into the next for holistic policy design.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using prompts verbatim without customization** → Always add your specific data and context
2. **Accepting first output as final** → Iterate and refine for quality
3. **Skipping validation** → All numbers and claims must be verified
4. **Ignoring political economy** → Technical solutions must be politically feasible
5. **Working in isolation** → Consult stakeholders early and often

# Appendix: Best Practices & Guidelines {.unnumbered}

## A. Understanding the Expert Role Framework

### Purpose of Expert Roles

The expert roles in these prompts serve several important functions:

1. **Analytical Framing**: Establish the appropriate perspective and depth for analysis
2. **Knowledge Activation**: Help AI models access relevant economic frameworks and methodologies
3. **Consistency**: Ensure responses follow established analytical approaches
4. **Quality Benchmarking**: Set expectations for sophistication and rigor

### What Expert Roles Are NOT

- **NOT Impersonation**: You're not pretending to be a specific person
- **NOT Authority**: The role doesn't grant special credibility to AI outputs
- **NOT Endorsement**: Named experts haven't reviewed or endorsed analyses
- **NOT Substitution**: Expert roles don't replace actual expert consultation

### How to Use Expert Roles Effectively

**Generic Roles Work Better**:
- "Sovereign Debt Specialist" is more flexible than specific names
- Focuses on expertise domain rather than individual identity
- Ages better (doesn't become outdated)
- Avoids false authority claims

**Customize as Needed**:
```
Instead of: "You are a [Named Person]"
Use: "You are a [Functional Role] with expertise in [Specific Domain]"
```

**Examples of Effective Role Descriptions**:
- "Tax Policy Specialist with expertise in developing economy tax systems"
- "Monetary Policy Expert focusing on inflation targeting in emerging markets"
- "Trade Economist specializing in export competitiveness analysis"

## B. Quality Control Framework

### Three-Layer Verification Process

**Layer 1: Internal Consistency Check**
- Do the numbers add up mathematically?
- Are conclusions logically supported by analysis?
- Are all assumptions explicitly stated?
- Do recommendations follow from diagnosis?
- Is the analytical framework applied correctly?

**Layer 2: External Validation**
- Cross-reference all statistics with authoritative sources
- Verify methodologies against peer-reviewed literature
- Check if similar analyses exist for comparator countries
- Validate frameworks against international best practices
- Test data vintage and revisions

**Layer 3: Expert Review**
- Share draft with actual domain experts (anonymized if sensitive)
- Present findings to stakeholder groups for reality check
- Conduct peer review before final publication
- Test assumptions through consultation with practitioners
- Validate political economy assessments with experienced policymakers

### Common Red Flags

**Analytical Issues**:
- Overly optimistic projections without sensitivity analysis
- Round numbers without confidence intervals or ranges
- Missing caveats and limitations sections
- Recommendations without implementation roadmap
- Ignoring political economy constraints entirely

**Data Issues**:
- Statistics without sources
- Mixing different base years without adjustment
- Using nominal vs real without clarity
- Inconsistent definitions across comparisons
- Outdated data presented as current

**Methodological Issues**:
- Inappropriate frameworks for context
- Missing robustness checks
- Over-reliance on single approach
- Ignoring relevant literature
- Unclear assumptions

## C. Prompt Engineering for Economics

### Enhancing Output Quality

**1. Add Context-Specific Detail**
```
Generic: "Design tax reform"

Specific: "Design tax reform that:
- Increases tax-GDP ratio from 9% to 15% over 5 years
- Reduces burden on salaried class earning <PKR 100K/month by 30%
- Brings 5M informal sector businesses into tax net
- Survives election cycle with coalition government
- Can be implemented with current FBR capacity constraints"
```

**2. Request Structured Formats**
```
Add to any prompt:
"Structure your analysis as follows:
1. Executive Summary (200 words max)
2. Context and Problem Statement (300 words)
3. Analytical Framework (explain methodology)
4. Key Findings (5 numbered points with supporting evidence)
5. Priority Recommendations (3 actions with timeline and responsible parties)
6. Implementation Risks (table format with mitigation strategies)
7. Monitoring Framework (KPIs with baselines and targets)
8. Technical Appendix (assumptions, data sources, calculations)"
```

**3. Demand Evidence and Sourcing**
```
Add requirement:
"For each empirical claim:
- Cite specific data source and year
- Provide international comparison (minimum 2 comparable countries)
- State confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Show sensitivity to key assumptions
- Flag any data quality concerns"
```

**4. Specify Target Audience**
```
Choose one and add to prompt:
"Write this for:
- Technical audience: Econometricians and academic researchers - use formal modeling, equations, statistical tests
- Policy audience: Ministers and senior bureaucrats - focus on key insights, implementation, political economy
- Public audience: Educated citizens and journalists - accessible language, minimize jargon, clear examples
- International audience: Donors and IFIs - emphasize international best practices, comparisons, standards"
```

### Iterative Refinement Strategies

**Five-Round Approach**:

**Round 1 - Comprehensive Overview**:
"Provide complete analysis as specified"

**Round 2 - Deep Dive**:
"Expand section X with:
- More quantitative analysis
- International comparisons
- Alternative scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis"

**Round 3 - Implementation Focus**:
"Add practical implementation considerations:
- Political economy analysis
- Institutional requirements
- Capacity constraints
- Sequencing logic
- Quick wins vs long-term reforms"

**Round 4 - Communication Products**:
"Generate:
- 2-page executive summary
- 10-slide presentation outline
- Op-ed version (800 words)
- FAQ section (10 common questions)"

**Round 5 - Validation Materials**:
"Create:
- Assumption testing framework
- Data validation checklist
- Expert review questions
- Stakeholder consultation guide"

### Multi-Prompt Workflows

**Sequential Analysis** (Follow logical progression):
1. **Diagnostic**: What's the problem? (Use diagnostic prompts)
2. **Solutions**: What are options? (Use design prompts)
3. **Prioritization**: What should we do? (Use prioritization frameworks)
4. **Implementation**: How do we execute? (Use implementation prompts)
5. **Monitoring**: How do we track? (Use M&E prompts)

**Parallel Analysis** (Cross-validate):
- Run same prompt with different AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Compare outputs for consistency and completeness
- Synthesize best elements from each response
- Use contradictions to identify areas of genuine uncertainty
- Document where models agree (higher confidence) vs disagree (needs expert input)

**Integrated Analysis** (Comprehensive policy packages):

*Example: Financial Sector Reform*
- Prompt 35: Capital Markets → identify market failures
- Prompt 36: Islamic Finance → inclusive finance dimension
- Prompt 37: Fintech Regulation → innovation enablement
- Prompt 38: NPL Resolution → banking sector health
- Prompt 43: Banking Consolidation → structural optimization

Each output informs the next, building comprehensive reform package.

## D. Data Requirements & Sources

### Essential Data Sources by Category

**National Official Sources**:
- **Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS)**: National accounts, HIES (household survey), Labor Force Survey, price indices
- **State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)**: Monetary aggregates, balance of payments, financial stability, banking statistics
- **Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)**: Tax revenue, filer statistics, customs data
- **Ministry of Finance**: Budget documents, Economic Survey, Fiscal Operations, debt reports
- **NEPRA**: Energy generation, distribution, tariffs, circular debt
- **SECP**: Corporate registrations, capital markets, non-bank financial institutions

**International Databases**:
- **World Bank**: World Development Indicators (WDI), Doing Business (archived), Poverty & Inequality, Governance Indicators
- **IMF**: World Economic Outlook (WEO), Article IV consultations, Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), Financial Soundness Indicators
- **Asian Development Bank**: Key Indicators for Asia and Pacific, ADO (Asian Development Outlook)
- **United Nations**: COMTRADE (trade), FAO (agriculture), ILO (labor), UNDESA (population)
- **OECD**: DAC database (aid), development indicators for comparisons

**Specialized International Sources**:
- **Penn World Tables**: Long-run growth, productivity, capital stocks
- **World Inequality Database**: Detailed inequality measures
- **Atlas of Economic Complexity**: Trade, product space, complexity indices
- **Global Financial Data**: Historical economic statistics
- **Our World in Data**: Curated datasets on development themes

### Data Quality Assessment

**Before Using Any Data, Ask**:

1. **Recency**: Is data from last 2 years for baseline? (Older may miss recent developments)
2. **Authority**: Is source official/peer-reviewed? (Prefer PBS/SBP over media reports)
3. **Methodology**: Is calculation method transparent? Can results be replicated?
4. **Revisions**: Have statistics been revised? (GDP, CPI often revised - note vintage)
5. **Comparability**: Are international comparisons valid? (Same definitions, base years, methods)
6. **Completeness**: Are there gaps? (Missing years, provinces, sectors)
7. **Consistency**: Do figures add up? (Do components sum to totals?)

**Red Flags**:
- Inconsistencies between sources for same statistic
- Round numbers suspiciously often (suggests estimation not measurement)
- Missing metadata (no methodology notes)
- Discontinued series without explanation
- Unexpected discontinuities (check for breaks)

### Handling Data Limitations

**When Data Is Imperfect** (which is often):

1. **Acknowledge limitations** explicitly in methodology section
2. **Use ranges** rather than point estimates when uncertain
3. **Triangulate** using multiple data sources
4. **Sensitivity analysis**: test conclusions with different data assumptions
5. **Flag uncertainty**: clearly mark low-confidence estimates

**Example**:
"Informal sector size is estimated at 35-45% of GDP (PBS estimates 36%, World Bank 42%, with substantial methodological uncertainty). Conclusions are robust across this range, but readers should note this is among the least reliably measured economic indicators."

## E. Ethical Considerations

### Responsible Use of AI-Generated Analysis

**1. Transparency Requirements**

**In Methodology Section**:
```
"This analysis was developed using [AI Model Name/Version] with structured 
economic prompts. The AI was provided with expert role framing (e.g., 'Sovereign 
Debt Specialist'), analytical frameworks (e.g., IMF DSA methodology), and 
specific output requirements. All AI-generated content was:
- Verified against primary sources [list key sources]
- Reviewed by [name/title of reviewers]
- Validated through [describe validation process]
Complete prompt text is provided in Appendix X for reproducibility."
```

**In Presentations**:
Include slide: "Methodology: AI-Assisted Analysis"
- AI tool used as analytical support
- All outputs verified by human experts
- Human judgment applied to recommendations

**2. Attribution Standards**

**What to Attribute**:
- Specific economic frameworks (e.g., "Hausmann-Rodrik-Velasco Growth Diagnostics")
- Data sources (with year and specific tables/pages)
- Previous studies informing approach
- This prompt document if used

**What NOT to Claim**:
- That named experts endorsed the analysis (they haven't)
- That AI outputs represent "expert consensus" (they don't)
- Original discovery of established knowledge
- More certainty than evidence supports

**3. Limitation Disclosure**

**Always State**:
- "AI models are trained primarily on Western economic literature; frameworks may require adaptation to Pakistani context"
- "Technical economic optimality may differ from politically feasible solutions"
- "This analysis should inform—not replace—expert judgment and stakeholder consultation"
- "Uncertainty levels: [high/medium/low] for key estimates"

**4. Bias Awareness**

**AI Limitations in Economic Analysis**:

- **Geographic bias**: Training data over-represents Western economies; may miss Pakistan-specific dynamics
- **Temporal bias**: Training cutoff means missing recent developments
- **Publication bias**: Published research may not reflect full range of expert opinion
- **Formalism bias**: AI may over-weight technical elegance vs practical implementability
- **Optimism bias**: May underestimate implementation challenges, political constraints
- **Status quo bias**: May not adequately consider transformative changes

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Explicitly prompt for Pakistan-specific considerations
- Request alternative scenarios including "radical reform"
- Ask "What could go wrong?" for every recommendation
- Validate against local expert knowledge
- Test assumptions with stakeholders

### Avoiding Misuse

**Inappropriate Uses** (DON'T):

1. **Confirmatory Analysis**: Using AI to justify pre-determined conclusions while ignoring contradictory findings
2. **Cherry-Picking**: Presenting only favorable AI findings while suppressing caveats and limitations
3. **False Authority**: Claiming AI analysis represents expert consensus or has been endorsed by named economists
4. **Substituting Consultation**: Using AI instead of engaging actual stakeholders and affected communities
5. **Premature Implementation**: Deploying recommendations without piloting and learning
6. **Proprietary Claims**: Claiming ownership of widely-known frameworks that AI helped explain

**Appropriate Uses** (DO):

1. **Exploratory Analysis**: Use AI to quickly explore multiple analytical approaches and scenarios
2. **Framework Learning**: Understand established economic frameworks and methodologies
3. **Starting Point**: Treat AI outputs as first draft requiring substantial refinement
4. **Capacity Building**: Help teams learn analytical techniques and frameworks
5. **Scenario Generation**: Develop multiple scenarios for discussion and stress-testing
6. **Literature Synthesis**: Understand state of academic/policy debates (with verification)

### Professional Standards

**Before Publishing or Presenting AI-Assisted Analysis**:

□ All data points verified against primary sources
□ Methodology section clearly discloses AI assistance
□ Expert reviewers have validated approach and findings
□ Stakeholders consulted on feasibility and political economy
□ Limitations and uncertainties explicitly stated
□ Attribution to sources proper and complete
