# AI for Excel: District Deprivation Data Analysis Exercises

## Overview
This guide provides simple exercises to demonstrate AI capabilities in Excel for participants unfamiliar with R or Python. The exercises use Pakistani district-level deprivation data across multiple dimensions.

---

## Exercise 1: Basic Data Summary
**Objective:** Get AI to describe the data and calculate basic statistics

**Prompts to try:**
- "Summarize this data and tell me what columns we have"
- "What are the average Overall scores by Province?"
- "Which districts have the highest and lowest Overall deprivation scores?"

**Learning Outcome:** Participants see how AI can quickly understand and summarize data without formulas

---

## Exercise 2: Creating Visualizations
**Objective:** Generate charts without manually selecting data

**Prompts to try:**
- "Create a bar chart showing the top 10 districts with highest Overall deprivation"
- "Make a scatter plot comparing Housing vs Health Services scores"
- "Create a column chart comparing average scores across all provinces"

**Learning Outcome:** AI can instantly create appropriate visualizations

---

## Exercise 3: Comparative Analysis
**Objective:** Compare regions and identify patterns

**Prompts to try:**
- "Which province has the worst average scores in Access to Public Education?"
- "Compare BALOCHISTAN and PUNJAB across all deprivation categories"
- "Find districts where Housing scores are much worse than their Overall scores"

**Learning Outcome:** AI performs multi-step analysis that would require complex formulas

---

## Exercise 4: Filtering and Sorting
**Objective:** Find specific subsets of data

**Prompts to try:**
- "Show me all SINDH districts with Overall scores above 0.5"
- "List districts where Communication & Transportation is their biggest problem"
- "Find districts with Distance values greater than 0"

**Learning Outcome:** Natural language replaces complex filter menus

---

## Exercise 5: Creating Derived Insights
**Objective:** Calculate new metrics and categorizations

**Prompts to try:**
- "Add a column that categorizes Overall scores as 'Low' (<0.3), 'Medium' (0.3-0.6), or 'High' (>0.6) deprivation"
- "Calculate which deprivation category has the highest score for each district"
- "Create a score that averages only the infrastructure-related columns (Housing, Communication & Transportation)"

**Learning Outcome:** AI creates new calculated columns without formula knowledge

---

## Exercise 6: Conditional Formatting Insights
**Objective:** Highlight important patterns

**Prompts to try:**
- "Highlight all districts where Access to Health Services is above 0.7"
- "Color-code the provinces in different colors"
- "Make a heat map of all the deprivation scores"

**Learning Outcome:** Visual formatting without manual setup

---

## Exercise 7: What-If Questions
**Objective:** Explore hypothetical scenarios

**Prompts to try:**
- "If we could improve the worst 10 districts' Overall scores by 20%, what would be the new average?"
- "Which districts would move from 'High' to 'Medium' deprivation if their scores decreased by 0.1?"

**Learning Outcome:** AI handles scenario analysis naturally

---

## Exercise 8: Data Quality Checks
**Objective:** Identify issues or anomalies

**Prompts to try:**
- "Are there any missing values in this dataset?"
- "Find any districts that appear more than once"
- "Which districts have Distance values that aren't zero, and what might that mean?"

**Learning Outcome:** AI can audit data without manual inspection

---

## Exercise 9: Cross-Category Analysis
**Objective:** Find correlations and relationships

**Prompts to try:**
- "Is there a relationship between Demographics scores and Livelihoods scores?"
- "Do districts with poor Housing also tend to have poor Health Services?"
- "Calculate the correlation between all pairs of deprivation categories"

**Learning Outcome:** Statistical analysis without knowing statistics

---

## Exercise 10: Report Generation
**Objective:** Create summary reports

**Prompts to try:**
- "Create a summary report showing the 3 most deprived districts in each province"
- "Write a brief analysis of which provinces need the most support"
- "Generate a table showing each province's rank across all deprivation categories"

**Learning Outcome:** AI compiles multi-step analysis into readable reports

---

## Bonus: Progressive Complexity Demo

**Demonstrate how AI builds from simple to complex:**

1. **Step 1:** "What's the average Overall score?" *(Basic calculation)*
2. **Step 2:** "What's the average Overall score by Province?" *(Grouping)*
3. **Step 3:** "Show this in a chart" *(Visualization)*
4. **Step 4:** "Now highlight provinces above the national average" *(Conditional logic)*
5. **Step 5:** "Create a dashboard showing top insights from this data" *(Complex integration)*

**Purpose:** This progression shows how AI makes complex analysis accessible to non-technical users!

## Tips for Demonstrating

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with Exercise 1 to build confidence
2. **Show Mistakes:** Demonstrate how to refine prompts if AI misunderstands
3. **Encourage Experimentation:** Let participants suggest their own questions
4. **Compare Traditional Methods:** Briefly show how long the same task would take manually
5. **Emphasize Natural Language:** Stress that they can ask questions as they would to a colleague

## Dataset Information

**Columns in the data:**
- DISTRICT: Name of the district
- PROVINCE: Province name (PUNJAB, SINDH, KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA, BALOCHISTAN, FATA)
- Distance: Matching distance metric
- Overall: Overall deprivation score
- Housing: Housing deprivation score
- Communication & Transportation: Infrastructure access score
- Livelihoods: Economic opportunity score
- Access to Health Services: Healthcare access score
- Access to Public Education: Education access score
- Demographics: Demographic vulnerability score

**Note:** Higher scores indicate greater deprivation/worse conditions.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of these exercises, participants should understand:
- AI can understand data context without programming
- Complex analysis becomes conversational
- Visualizations are generated on demand
- Data exploration is faster and more intuitive
- Technical skills are democratized through natural language
